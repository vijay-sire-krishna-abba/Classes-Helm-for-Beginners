Well, thank you so much for watching this course. Through this course, we got an introduction to

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.960
Helm and understood the basic concepts. We discussed the basics of Helm, we saw

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.320
how to install Helm and get started with it. We saw the architecture of Helm, we looked at charts,

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.360
releases, revisions, repositories. And we also saw how to write our own charts. So we looked

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.920
at functions, we understood pipelines, conditionals, with blocks, ranges, and hooks.

6
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:35.279
And finally, we also looked at the packaging, signing and uploading mechanisms. Please share

7
00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:40.320
your feedback on what additional topics you'd like for us to cover. And we will make put in

8
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.040
our best efforts to add those to this course. I hope you enjoyed this course, and the associated

9
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.919
