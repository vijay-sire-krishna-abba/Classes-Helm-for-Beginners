Well, thank you so much for watching this course. Through this course, we got an introduction to Helm and understood the basic concepts. We discussed the basics of Helm, we saw how to install Helm and get started with it. We saw the architecture of Helm, we looked at charts, releases, revisions, repositories. And we also saw how to write our own charts. So we looked at functions, we understood pipelines, conditionals, with blocks, ranges, and hooks. And finally, we also looked at the packaging, signing and uploading mechanisms. Please share your feedback on what additional topics you'd like for us to cover. And we will make put in our best efforts to add those to this course. I hope you enjoyed this course, and the associated labs as much as I enjoyed building it. So don't forget to share your course completion certificate on social media. Until next time, this is Mumshad Mannambeth signing off. Goodbye
