00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.960
In this section, we will talk briefly about installing Helm. And before installing Helm,

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.640
you must first have a functional Kubernetes cluster and kubectl installed and configured

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.080
on your local computer with the right login details set up in the kubeconfig file to work

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.120
with the intended Kubernetes cluster. Now Helm can be installed on Linux, Windows or Mac OS systems.

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.799
We will go over the instructions on installing Helm on Linux systems in this lecture.

6
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.880
Systems with Snap can install Helm using the snap install helm command.

7
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.400
Use the classic option to install a more relaxed sandbox that gives the app a bit more access to

8
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.680
the host system. So rather than strictly isolating it to its separate environment.

9
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.680
This way, Helm can easily access the kubeconfig file in your home directory. So it knows how to

10
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.400
connect to our Kubernetes cluster. For apt-based systems, such as the Debian or Ubuntu, follow the

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.959
instructions to add key and sources list before installing Helm. And for PKG, run the package

12
00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:14.959
install Helm command. Always refer to the latest instructions from the documentation pages to

13
00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:20.320
install Helm for your version of operating system. Well, that's all for now. Head over

14
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.800
to the labs and practice working with installing Helm on our lab environment.
