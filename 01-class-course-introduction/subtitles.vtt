Hello, and welcome. My name is Mumshad Mannambeth, and I will be your instructor. In this course,

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.760
we will learn about Helm and how it helps ease the deployment and lifecycle management of

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.639
applications deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. Throughout this course, we will learn the basics

4
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:28.360
of Helm, we will see how to install and get started with it, we will then learn about the

5
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.119
architecture and the various components part of Helm, such as charts, repos, releases and revisions,

6
00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:39.220
we look at charts and how to develop our own charts from scratch. And we look at functions,

7
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.000
pipelines, conditionals, and with blocks, we look at ranges and hooks. And finally, we will look at

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.480
packaging, signing and uploading charts. Now, as with all of our other courses, we have video

9
00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.360
lectures in this course that simplify complex topics. And these are followed by hands-on labs

10
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.800
that are embedded in the course where you'll work with the real Kubernetes cluster, right in your

11
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.320
browser. So you can go from watching a video and learning the concepts to practicing through

12
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.000
challenging hands-on lab exercises in just a few seconds. Well, I can't wait to get started. So

13
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.919
I'll see you in the first lesson.
